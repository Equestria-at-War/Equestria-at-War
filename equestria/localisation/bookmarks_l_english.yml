 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Dawn of War"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Future casts a dark shadow on Equestria and its neighbors. Stalliongrad quickly industrialilzes and causes restlessness among equestrian higher ranks. Crystal Empire is on verge of becoming slave on Sombra's Tyrrany once again. And most importantly Changelings hives are rising under the flag of Queen Chrysalis with aim of establishing their hegemony over the whole world."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 EQS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Equestria, the glorious empire where sun never sets. Ruled by an alicorn more than a thousand years old, Princess Celestia, and her alicorn sister Princess Luna, that has been recently brought back from her imprisonment on the Moon. It may seem that nothing can shaken their reign in this land, as Equestria successfully managed to fade off all of the external theats it was exposed to in recent years. However, there are powers rising in the world today, that soon will be able to challenge unshaken Equestrian power."
 CHN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Not so long ago changelings made an attempt to take full contol of Equestria by infiltrating into ponies ranks and capturing Canterlot, however this endevour turned out to be a devastating failure for Changelings. Today, Queen Chrysalis has gathered strong support among changeling population as they seek revenge on the pony nation for all of their past defeats. But this time, it looks like they're coming in strength."
 STG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Soviet Republic of Stalliongrad is located in Equestrian northeast. Not so long ago the newly established state has split from Equestria and Crystal Empire for building a new pony society, in which everybody will be socially equal. Today's situation is quite far from perfect utopia that is described in the works. Ponies suffer from lack of resources and food, as the region was quite fully dependend on southern Equestrian territories in that sense. Having sanctioned them, Equestria limited their supplies. Besides these problems, there're serious disagreements in the communist party."
 OLE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Olenia is home of the deer nation and it has been a strong trading power of the north in the past. Political instability and the unlawful rise of the new tyrant king has caused terrible problems for lower classes of population and severely damanged the reputation of the state on diplomatic arena."
 CRY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Protectorate state of Equestria, Crystal Empire is one of the leading countries on the continent, ruled by recently installed monarch Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, when the attempt of magically banished King Sombra to bring back his power ended in a complete failure. And however he is gone again. It doesn't mean he will sleep forever."
 YAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "An agrarian country of Yaks in Equestrian north was always far from being involved in high politics of the rest of the world. This situation may change soon as the interest to this strategically important region increases every day."
GRF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the collapse of the Griffon's ancient Empire nearly 30 years ago Nova Griffonia has found itself independant for the first time after 200 years. However due to Nova Griffonia's over-reliance on Imperial industrial goods and military protection she has found herself suffering heavily in the recent years. Her armies are comprised of militias barely held together by their commanders, the economy has practically collapsed, to top it off the many dissidents the old Empire sent to her shores have become more active and violent than ever. The only thing keeping the country together is Governor Teafether's sheer force of will, but no one lives forever..."
