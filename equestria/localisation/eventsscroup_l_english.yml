cryscr.1.t:0 "Celebration is planned!"
cryscr.1.d:0 "Due to the economic problems the government could not support the tradition with an official celebration of the Winter Soltice holiday last year. However, undoubtedly the situation will change during this year. And we will hold a grand festival on the Winter Soltice day!"
cryscr.1.a:0 "Hurray!"
cryscr.2.t:0 "Flurry Heart birthday!"
cryscr.2.d:0 "The Flurry Heart is the baby princess of our current Princess, Mi Amore Cadenza. And today she is celebrating her second birthday! Congratulations to the happy family from all the ponies of our vast homeland, the Crystal Empire. Long live the Princesses!"
cryscr.2.a:0 "Yay!"
cryscr.3.t:0 "The Winter Soltice Celebration!"
cryscr.3.d:0 "One of many ancient tradition of the Crystal ponies is also celebrating the winter soltice, when the sun is lowest on the horizon and the night is longest. In medieval times it was an important turn in the season, as it meant that the first half of the harsh crystalline winter was finally over and that brought everypony hope for a warm spring and the start of the sowing season. The celebration was attended by many crystal ponies and tourists from Equestria with yet another visit of the equestrian royalty."
cryscr.3.a:0 "Hurray!"
cryscr.3.t:0 "Preparations for Equestria Games"
cryscr.3.d:0 "Prepare for Equestrian Games!"
cryscr.3.a:0 "Hurray!"
cryscr.4.t:0 "Equestria Games Preparations!"
cryscr.4.d:0 "Celestia is planning to oraganize Equestria Games in Crystal City. It would be best to support this enterprise for our good, because events as such unite ponies and celebrate friendship among them."
cryscr.4.a:0 "Right."
cryscr.5.t:0 "Crystal Fair"
cryscr.5.d:0 "Crystal Fair is one of the oldest traditions of the Crystal Empire and it is shame that we have to ask permission and funds to hold the event from Equestria."
cryscr.5.a:0 "Send the proposal."
cryscr.6.t:0 "Crystal Empire wants to hold Crystal Fair."
cryscr.6.d:0 "Princess Cadence asks us to support the Crystal Fair celebration."
cryscr.6.a:0 "Okay."
cryscr.6.b:0 "We don't have money for that."
cryscr.7.t:0 "Equestria Agrees"
cryscr.7.d:0 "Princess Celestia granted us permission to carry out the Crystal Fair."
cryscr.7.a:0 "Great!"
cryscr.11.t:0 "The Group of Dissatisfied."
cryscr.11.d:0 "Rumors go across the Crystal City that there exists a group of ponies that support the old Sombra's regime. That is very unlikely, because there are still ponies that have lived under Sombra's tyrrany and horror of his enslavement lives in the hearts of the crystal ponies. Spectre of the past haunts the Crystal Empire."
cryscr.11.a:0 "Can't be true."
cryscr.12.t:0 "An interesting meet."
cryscr.12.d:0 "On one of the usual [GetMonth] day in the Crystal City you take a walk along one of the streets. You stop near a souvenir shop and glance at a poster with a pony in over-exaggerated, heavy chains and dark silhouette of King Sombra in the background. "May the tyranny never return in the Crystal lands" reads the writing. - Who would ever pin that in their room? - you wonder. Suddenly a young, pretty pony with light pink coloured fur and dark blue hair stops by you as you find yourself gazing over the poster and several figures of King Sombra. You turn to her to find she also stares at the things the store sells. - Wish he returns one day, - she says quietly. - What? - you ask. - Have you ever wondered, what would the Crystal Empire be like, if King Sombra returned? - she replied. You look at her, stunned. - Come join us to find out, - she says and puts a note into your hoof."
cryscr.12.a:0 "A-alright."
cryscr.12.b:0 "Are you crazy?!"
cryscr.13.t:0 "Interesting Development."
cryscr.13.d:0 "You're given an invitation to a club called "Stories of the Frost", as it says on the card. The description on the other side reads: "Join historical literature club of the Amethyst University. Tea, cookies and long talks about world history are granted! Topfloor, 37.". Sounds like fun, you think. The girl however, without long goodbyes, walks away, before you can ask anything else. On the other side of the invitation card you can see a detailed location the club."
cryscr.13.a:0 "I will have to check that out."
cryscr.13.b:0 "Not worth it, eh."
cryscr.14.t:0 "Forget it!"
cryscr.14.d:0 "You throw the invitation card away. Whirling in the light breeze, it falls down onto the pavement. - Are you serious? Why would you want that?! He destroyed our country! He... - you didn't finish, as the pony turned away, giving you a glance of scorn. You turn around and walk away, wishing to forget this incident."
cryscr.14.a:0 "These youngsters."
cryscr.15.t:0 "It's about time"
cryscr.15.d:0 "It's been a while since you met the pony girl near the souvenir shop. However up until now you kept the card and today, you finally had the time to follow the instructions that supposedly should lead you to the club location. As there was something alluring in that card, that girl and what she said that day. You took a walk through the streets and found yourself on the end of the suggested route. An ordinary, newly built aparment building was in front of you."
cryscr.15.a:0 "Right into the 37."
cryscr.15.b:0 "What am I doing?"
cryscr.16.t:0 "First Meeting."
cryscr.16.d:0 "You walk all the way to the top floor of the apartment building. Slowly taking the stairs in anticipation. After knocking on the wooden door, you are greeted by a stallion in an old, dusty magician robe. - Is this some kind of cosplay meeting? - you think. The stallion motions you to come in and closes the door, after you enter. The apartment is illuminated only by pony magic, candles, luminous plants and crystals. Despite this terrible lighting system, you can distinguish a bunch of ponies on the couch, at the table and on the floor. Suddenly, the pony you met at the store comes up to you out of dark doorway, which as you suppose leads to the kitchen, - I was waiting! - exclaims she with excitement."
cryscr.16.a:0 "Oh, huh?"
cryscr.17.t:0 "The Club."
cryscr.17.d:0 "- Welcome to the history club! Hurray! - she cries joyfully. Everypony support her with a weary "Hurray". - We are studying magic, literature, history, politics and evolution science here, but most improtantly, we are united by one idea: the Crystal Empire needs Sombra back!\n- What makes you think this is such a good thing? - you ask after a short silence. - Apparently, this guy never read a history book in his life, - remarks a colt from darkness. A wave of quiet giggling rolls in the room. - What do you know, that I don't? - you say. -Sit down, - says an old stallion, who was also wearing an antique magicians mantle."
cryscr.17.a:0 "Right."
cryscr.18.t:0 "The Stories of the Forst"
cryscr.18.d:0 "As you sit down around a coffee table with a flower emitting turquoise coloured light, the old pony begins his story.\n - I remember the King. I remember the times when the Crystal Empire was great and powerful, was really an Empire. The lands of the Yaks were under our control, the Northern Shores were our second home, and eastern lands of the deers... The Crystal Ponies were true masters of Equestria. The soil was rich, the grass was green, economy of the empire thrived and the ponies were free. It was then the Equestrian Alicorn sisters started to become jealous of the greatness and power. Using their dark magic of the so-called Elements of Harmony, they imprisoned the king and all of the Crystal ponies in a place outside time and space for more than a thousand years. And now, the Crystal Empire is impertinently stomped on by the sisters of Equestria and their puppet, unlawfully setup princess Mi Amore Cadenza. Thus we only see our future, and the future of the Crystal nation with return of King Sombra. With our help and his magic, we will bring the old Glory of the Crystal Empire back! - the stallion stopped and started coughing."
cryscr.18.a:0 "I see."
cryscr.19.t:0 "An Offer of the Lifetime"
cryscr.19.d:0 "For more than two hours the ponies narrated you the history of the Crystal Empire, the times when King Sombra ruled over the land. That he was wise, just and cared about the people. That the sisters envied his glory and majesty. All of this greatly differed from the equestrian narrative, but sounded so convincing and motivational.\n - We've been watching you for months, - says the old pony suddenly, - We know you want to help. We know, you want to aid King Sombra's escape from his shameful prison. The crystal ponies must rise against decay and opression. The time is perfect, frankly, as the stars align in the correct position only one time in five hundred years. The current position will strengthen the reincarnation spell. There is a way to bring King Sombra back, but we need your help! Together, we will change the history of the Crystal Empire, and maybe the whole world, to better!"
cryscr.19.a:0 "Right."
cryscr.20.t:0 "The Decision"
cryscr.20.d:0 "You exit the apartment and walk home, reconsidering your life choices. You were offered to change history, are you really that powerful, do you really have a right to decide lifes of millions of ponies? - The group believed me, but what if they really succeed, - you say, - Maybe I should report that to police while we've still got time? - Thinking about all that you lose track of time and route, endlessly wandering around the streets of the Crystal City."
